This project can download the specific music into the android folder.   
       
       
       
Motivation    
-------------------------
There're lots of app can play the music. But if you reformat your phone, all of your song would disappear. The google music player isn't available in Taiwan. On the other hand, there're some app can supply the same service. The disadvantage is that you should apply for different account that cannot remember easily. To be tired of search such kind of free application, I wrote this script.    

    
Usage     
-------------------------
There're two edition that you can use. I especially recommend the python version that It can show the detail of the songs. Enter the folder to see the detail.    


Notice    
-------------------------
* Run install.sh to install **first** whether you want to use python version or shell version
