========
This project can download the specific music into the android folder.   
       
       
Motivation    
-------------------------
There're lots of app can play the music. But if you reformat your phone, all of your song would disappear. The google music player isn't available in Taiwan. On the other hand, there're some app can supply the same service. The disadvantage is that you should apply for different account that cannot remember easily. To be tired of search such kind of free application, I wrote this script.    
     
       
Usage     
-------------------------
1. find the YouTube music URL that you want to download, and copy past to musicPath.txt **line by line**    
2. connect with your phone by USB line    
3. ```./downloadMusic.sh```    
      
      
Notice    
-------------------------
* If you didn't seen the song that have sent to your phone, try to reboot your phone!
